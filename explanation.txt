/*First: we accept arguments from user
Second:
	- we validate the file (see if the file exists)
	- ask for a password and validate it (for the encryption)
Finally: we encrypt/decrypt the file*/

/*				ENCRYPTION
We will create a random variable "nonce" which will be 12 bytes
and we will randomize it
The algorihtm we will be using is SHA-1
*/

/*				DECRYPTION
We will again ask for the password, then we will read the nonce by
reading the last 12 digits of the encrypted file
*/

/*
We will be encrypting and decrypting a text passed by the user
USING THE CEASER CIPHER
For example: 	HELLOWORLD		our key will be for now: 5

the original text: ABCDEFGHIJKLMOPQRSTUVWXYZ

	26 - (key)5 = 21	/		\
					  /			  \
		ABCDEFGHIJKLMOPQRSTU	  VWXYZ

the hashed text:	VWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMOPQRSTU

	index of H in original text: 8
	and we aplly the formula:
	pos + len(original letters)) % len(original letters)
	In put case:	(8+26)%26 = 8
	H -----> C
